# Data-Analysis-Bootcamp
-----------------------
Here are the results I obtained from existing chess match data.

The results include:

-The most favored openings according to rating gaps

-How many rounds the matches lasted according to the rating gaps

-Highest winning rates for "black" and "white" among the preferred openings

-How many games have ended in a draw because one side ran out of time but did not have enough pieces for their opponent to checkmate
